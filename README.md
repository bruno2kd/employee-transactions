# ADP Innovation Labs Pre-Interview Assignment

This in an app build to as a pre-interview assignment for ADP Brazil Labs following the instructions you can find [here](https://interview.adpeai.com/). 

## Installation

  1. run `npm install`
  2. run `npm run serve` and a server will start in the port 8000
  3. click in the button and the results will show in the screen

## Requirements

node version 20  

## Usage

There are a home screen at `/` where you can click the button and will make a request to the endpoint `/api/adp-test` and the results will be shown in the screen. If you go to another endpoint, it will return a Not Found screen

## Considerations

- Fun and simple app build with no frameworks or libraries
- Main calculation is done with time complexity O(n) using a reduce function
- It was not clear to me what format was requested so I made an alternative way to see the results, just run `npm start` and the result will be printed in the console
